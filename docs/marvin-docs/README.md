## PDF -> PNG Converter Script | Python

Designed and implemented a Python script that took in a path to a PDF file as a command line argument that would then convert each page of the PDF file into a series of PNG files that are clustered together into a new directory within the directory.

## PyTorch Tutorials

Began watching and learning more about PyTorch through the *Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs* series made by the youtuber *Jovian* (parts 1-4 only).
