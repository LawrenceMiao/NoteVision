## Neural Networks Introduction

Watched these videos by *3Blue1Brown* to get a fundamental understanding of what neural networks are and how they work.

### Chapter 1: [Video Link](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=bKe3I8pQEtDHPTxS) 

The video begins by presenting a handwritten digit "three" and marveling at how effortlessly our brains can recognize it, despite variations in pixel values. It introduces the challenge of creating a program that can perform this recognition and sets the stage for explaining neural networks.

The video emphasizes the importance and relevance of machine learning and neural networks. It aims to help viewers understand the structure of neural networks and how they work as a piece of mathematical machinery. The goal is to demystify neural networks and inspire confidence in understanding the concept of "neural network learning."

The focus of this video is primarily on the structure of a neural network. It introduces a simple neural network designed to recognize handwritten digits, with explanations about the layers, neurons, and their role in processing input data.

The video elaborates on neurons, explaining that they are units that hold numbers representing activations between 0 and 1. Neurons in the first layer represent pixel values in an input image, and there are layers of neurons in between (hidden layers) with weights and biases associated with them.

The importance of understanding these layers is discussed, particularly how they might detect edges and patterns, which are building blocks for recognizing digits. The concept of learning in neural networks is introduced, hinting at the process of finding the right values for the weights and biases.

The video transitions to the notation and linear algebra used to represent neural networks, highlighting that a neural network is essentially a complex mathematical function that takes input data and produces an output based on the interactions of weights, biases, and activations.

It emphasizes that learning in a neural network involves adjusting these weights and biases, and the complexity arises from the vast number of parameters (weights and biases) that can be tuned.

The video closes by introducing the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function as an alternative to the sigmoid function, which is commonly used in modern neural networks. This new activation function is explained as being easier to train for deep neural networks.

## PDF -> PNG Converter Script | Python

Designed and implemented a Python script that took in a path to a PDF file as a command line argument that would then convert each page of the PDF file into a series of PNG files that are clustered together into a new directory within the directory.

## PyTorch Tutorials

Began watching and learning more about PyTorch through the *Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs* series made by the youtuber *Jovian* (parts 1-4 only).
