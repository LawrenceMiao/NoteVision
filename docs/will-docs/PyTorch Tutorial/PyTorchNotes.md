 PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course

<h1> Course welcome and "what is deep learning?"</h1>

<h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
It is turning things(data) into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.
Computer finds the patterns

<h2>How do computers find patterns?</h2>
Code & math. We're going to be writing the code.


<h2>Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning</h2>
Artifical Intelligence <- Machine Learning <- Deep Learning
This course is more hands on and coding focus and we will be focusing on deep learning.

<h2>Traditional Programming:</h2>
Input ingredients and hard code instructions and rules to make a dish.

<h2>Machine Learning Algo:</h2>
Takes in inputs and knows the desired output and finds out the instructions to getting the 
desired outputs. Ideal machine learning algo will find the bridge between
the input and the ideal outputs.

<h2>"Why use machine learning vs Deep Learning?"</h2>
Can you think of all the instructions of a complex task?

<h2>Should you use maschine learning for everything even if you can?</h2>
If you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning, do that."
-Rule one of Google's Machine Learning Handbook

<h2>Things Deep Learning is good for:</h2>
-Problems with long lists of rules--when the traditional approach fails, machine learning/deep
learning may help. 
-Continually changing enviorments--deep learning can adapt ('learn') to new scenarios
-Discovering insights within large collections of data--can you imagine trying to hand-craft rules
for what 101 different kinds of food look like?

<h2>What deep learning is typically not good for:</h2>
-When you need explainiability--the paterns learned by a deep learning model are typically
uninterpretable by a human
-When the tradtional apprach is a better option
-When errors are unaccepteable (what about ai drive compares)
-When you don't have much data since deep learning models are learning for scratch and needs a large
amount of data to produce accurate results (though we will learn techniqus to get results without 
huge amounts of data)

<h2>Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning</h2>
For structured data use algorithims such as gradient boosted machine, a forest or a tree based algorithim.

Unstructured data use nueral networks. Tensors can give unstructured data a structure.

<h4><strong>Algorithims for Structured Data(Machine Learning):</strong></h4>
-Random forest
-Gradient boosted models
-Naive Bayes
-Nearest neighbor
-Support vector machine
-etcs...

Algroithims for Unstructured Data(Deep Learning):
<strong>-Neural Networks 
-Fully connected nueral networks
-Convolutional neural network</strong>
-Recurrent neural network
-Transformer
-etc...

<h2>P5: Different Learning Paradigms</h2>
Supervised Learning is when we give neural networks data that we have recognized and labeled. 
Unsupervised learning is when the neural networks are learning with just the data given and that neural network
will be able to discern the pattern between two different types of data.
Transfer learning takes the pattern one pattern has learned and transfering it to another model.
