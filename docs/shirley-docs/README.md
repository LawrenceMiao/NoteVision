# Documentation for Note Vision - Shirley Tom

This documentation contains all of progress on what I have learned during the learning period of the project.

## Video 1 - But what is a neural network? | Chapter 1, Deep learning

This video is the introduction into neural networks. Using the example of an AI learning to read a handwritten letter, the video does a deep dive into how the AI learns to recognize the number. There are layers to the neural network and each layer helps to determine the final number since each layer cooresponds to each component of the number.
