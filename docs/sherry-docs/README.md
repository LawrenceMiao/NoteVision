# Note Vision Documentation - Sherry Lin
 This file documents my learning process and my contributions while working on NoteVision.

Note Vision is an AI tool designed to help enable musicians and composers to transform physical sheet music to a MIDI file.

## Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I watched the following three videos by *3Blue1Brown* to get an understanding of what neural networks are, how they work, and what backpropagation is in order to better comprehend how deep learning works.

- [Chapter 1 | But what is a neural network?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=bKe3I8pQEtDHPTxS)
- [Chapter 2 | Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w?si=bdLgCjGBCk_S1ENU)
- [Chapter 3 | What is backpropagation really doing?](https://youtu.be/Ilg3gGewQ5U?si=7DkytDDaGr3OIsuv)

Some key points are:

- Neural networks contain neurons which can activate in layers to determine a final answer.
- The cost of the network allows it to calculate the negative gradient in order for proper learning.
- Backpropagation is the algorithm for computing the gradient descent.

## Expanding Python Knowledge

I explored multiple sources listed below to learn more about Python that Computer Science 1 did not cover. Topics include classes, files, NumPy, and Pillow. 

- [Python Inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp)
- [Dunder Methods](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/dunder-methods)
- [File Handling](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp)
- [Python File Open](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_open.asp)
- [Python File Write](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_write.asp)
- [Python Delete File](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_remove.asp)
- [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp)
- [Python Tutorial: Image Manipulation with Pillow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qs3wObeWwc)

I learned that:

- Python inheritance allows programmers to create child clases that inherit methods and properties from parent classes and allows child classes to override inherited methods. 
- Dunder methods let class objects interact with built-in functions, keywords, and operators of Python. 
- Python provides various handling functions including "open()", ".read()", ".readline()", ".close()", ".write()", ".remove()", and more. 
- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays and matrices and includes high-level mathematical functions.
- Pillow is a Python library that lets programmers work with and manipulate images.
