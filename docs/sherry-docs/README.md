  Note Vision is an AI tool designed to help enable musicians and composers to transform physical sheet music to a MIDI file.

## Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I watched the following three videos by *3Blue1Brown* to get an understanding of what neural networks are, how they work, and what backpropagation is in order to better comprehend how deep learning works.

- [Chapter 1 | But what is a neural network?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=bKe3I8pQEtDHPTxS)
- [Chapter 2 | Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w?si=bdLgCjGBCk_S1ENU)
- [Chapter 3 | What is backpropagation really doing?](https://youtu.be/Ilg3gGewQ5U?si=7DkytDDaGr3OIsuv)

Some key points are:

- Neural networks contain neurons which can activate in layers to determine a final answer.
- The cost of the network allows it to calculate the negative gradient in order for proper learning.
- Backpropagation is the algorithm for computing the gradient descent.
