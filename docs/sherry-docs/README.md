# Note Vision | Sherry Lin

Note Vision is an AI tool designed to help enable musicians and composers to transform physical sheet music to a MIDI file.

# Instructions to Install Necessary Environments
Python, Anaconda, Labelme, and Pytorch are necessary for the developement and implementation of NoteVision.

## Python
Python often comes pre-installed, so check if your device has Python or which version of Python it runs by running the following code:
```
python -version

# run if there is an error for the prior command
python3 â€“version
```
If both commands fail, then you likely do not have Python and need to download Python 3.

If the version number is Python 2.x.y, where x and y are unknown numbers, you will need to update to Python 3 because that version is no longer supported.

Head to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the appropriate OS version of Python, and run the command above again to make sure you have the latest version of Python 3.

## Anaconda
Download the appropriate version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your device or follow the appropriate installation guides below. (Note: make sure to follow the Anaconda specific instructions.)

- [Windows installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)
- [macOS installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html)

## LabelMe
LabelMe is a image annotation tool that lets users annotate images and export the annotations as a JSON file.

Follow this [link](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) for LabelMe installation. The instructions are simplified below:

### Anaconda
Run code below in Anaconda Prompt:
```
conda create --name=labelme python=3
source activate labelme
pip install labelme
```

### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install labelme
```

### macOS
```
brew install pyqt  
pip install labelme
```

### Windows
Run code below in Anaconda Prompt:
```
conda create --name=labelme python=3
conda activate labelme
pip install labelme
```

### App
Install app from: https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme/releases

### Run and Use LabelMe 
To run LabelMe in macOS, run `labelme` in the terminal. In the context of NoteVision, LabelMe is used to annotate sheet music and the annotations are saved as a JSON file. The JSON file is then run through the JSON parser Python script in order to remove unnecessary image attributes.

## PyTorch
PyTorch is a tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs.

Before installation, check to make sure you do not already have PyTorch downloaded. To check using Python code, follow the below instructions:

Run Python in your terminal or command prompt.
```
python3
```
Import the torch library, check the PyTorch version:
```
import torch
torch.__version__
```

If there is output and the version is the latest stable version, then you already have PyTorch. However, if you do not follow the instructions: 

1. Create a conda environment named `test_env`
```
conda create --name test_env
```
2. Activate `test_env`
```
conda activate test_env
```
3. Go to this [link](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and select the following:
  - PyTorch Build: Stable
  - Your OS: _Your OS_
  - Package: Conda
  - Language: Python
  - Compute Platform: Default (if Mac) OR CPU (if Windows/Linux)
4. Copy and paste the command into your environment, and run it.
5. Check that it successfully downloaded by following the instructions from above.

## Python Classes and Inheritance
Python inheritance allows programmers to create child clases that inherit methods and properties from parent classes and allows child classes to override inherited methods.
