## Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning

The following three videos by *3Blue1Brown* to get an understanding of what neural networks are, how they work, and what backpropagation is in order to better comprehend deep learning.

- [Chapter 1 | But what is a neural network?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=bKe3I8pQEtDHPTxS)
- [Chapter 2 | Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w?si=bdLgCjGBCk_S1ENU)
- [Chapter 3 | What is backpropagation really doing?](https://youtu.be/Ilg3gGewQ5U?si=7DkytDDaGr3OIsuv)

Backpropagation is the algorithm for computing the gradient descent.
