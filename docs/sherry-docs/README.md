# Note Vision Documentation - Sherry Lin
 This file documents my learning process while working on NoteVision.

  Note Vision is an AI tool designed to help enable musicians and composers to transform physical sheet music to a MIDI file.

## Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I watched the following three videos by *3Blue1Brown* to get an understanding of what neural networks are, how they work, and what backpropagation is in order to better comprehend how deep learning works.

- [Chapter 1 | But what is a neural network?](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=bKe3I8pQEtDHPTxS)
- [Chapter 2 | Gradient descent, how neural networks learn](https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w?si=bdLgCjGBCk_S1ENU)
- [Chapter 3 | What is backpropagation really doing?](https://youtu.be/Ilg3gGewQ5U?si=7DkytDDaGr3OIsuv)

Some key points are:

- Neural networks contain neurons which can activate in layers to determine a final answer.
- The cost of the network allows it to calculate the negative gradient in order for proper learning.
- Backpropagation is the algorithm for computing the gradient descent.

## Expanding Python Knowledge

I explored multiple sources listed below to learn more about Python that I did not know beforehand. Topics include classes, files, NumPy, and Pillow.
