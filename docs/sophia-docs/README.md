## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

### Chapter 1 - But what is a neural network?

- The task is to put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits
- Multilayer perceptron is the simplest variant of a neural network, yet it can still recognize handwritten digits.
- Network starts with neurons corresponding to pixels of an input image
- Each neuron holds a number holding a grayscale value; ranging from 0 for black pixels to 1 for white pixels and is lit up when the activation is a high number
- The activation in the neuron represents how much the system thinks the given image corresponds to a given digit
- The activation in one layer determines the activation in the next layer
- The brightest neuron of the output layer is the network's choice for what digit the image represents
- The goal is to have some mechanism that could combine pixels into edges into patterns into digits
- There is a weight assigned to each connection from one neuron to another
- The weighted sum of the pixel values would give us the region of pixels that we care about 
- Negative weights would help indicate where the edges are since they would be darker
