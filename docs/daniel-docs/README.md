## Neural Networks Introduction
I watched these videos by *3Blue1Brown* to get a fundamental understanding of what neural networks are and how they work.

##### Video 1 - But what is a neural network? | Chapter 1, Deep learning
- Neuron: a thing that holds a number between 0 and 1 that represents a greyscale value of a pixels.
    - Closer to 0 for darker pixels.
    - Closer to 1 for lighter pixels.
- A network can be represented as several layers containing the activations of neurons.
    - Besides the first layer, each layer is dependent on the layer before it because each neuron is connected to all of the neurons in the previous layer.
- Weights are assigned to each connection between layers to ensure that each pixel generates a valid activation value.
